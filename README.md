# Bitlyfy

An iOS 8 notification center widget for shortening URLs from the clipboard.

## Requirements
- XCode 6 or newer with Swift
- Bitly Access Token (retrievable [here](https://bitly.com/a/oauth_apps))

## Setup
1. Clone
2. Replace _your-access-token_ with your API token
3. Build and run

## That's all?
Yea, why? I think the bitly website sucks and I don't like the app, so why fucking not?
Oh there's a python version, too for those that stick to the command line (like me on my Mac ;))
